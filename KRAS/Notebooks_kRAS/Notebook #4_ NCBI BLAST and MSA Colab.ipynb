This\n","program aligns the most similar segments between sequences. BLAST aligns\n","sequences using a scoring matrix similar to BLOSUM (see entry). This scoring\n","method gives penalties for gaps and gives the highest score for identical\n","residues. Substitutions are scored based on how conservative the changes are.\n","The output shows a list of sequences, with the highest scoring sequence at the\n","top. The scoring output is given as an E-value. The lower the E-value, the\n","higher scoring the sequence is. E-values in the range of 1^-100 to 1^-50 are very similar (or even identical) sequences. Sequences with E-values 1^-10 and higher need to be examined based on other methods to determine homology. An Evalue of 1^-10 for a sequence can be interpreted as, “a 1 in 1^10 chance that the sequence was pulled from the database by chance alone (has no homology to the query sequence).” This program can be accessed from the NCBI homepage or:\n","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST\n","\n","**ClustalW** is a program for making multiple sequence alignments. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html\n","\n","FASTA is a way of formatting a nuleic acid or protein sequence.

The FASTA format has a title line for each sequence that begins\n","with a “>” followed by any needed text to name the sequence. The end of\n","the title line is signified by a paragraph mark (hit the return key).\n","Bioinformatics programs will know that the title line isn’t part of the sequence if you have it formatted correctly.
