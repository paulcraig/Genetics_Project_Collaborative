When these enzyme deficiencies occur, there is not only a decrease in the products of the pathway, but the intermediates in the pathway also build up.  Symptoms of metabolic disease occur from one or both of these biochemical causes.  Often, the build-up and storage of the metabolic intermediates cause the major symptoms associated with these diseases.\n","\n","Lesch-Nyhan disease is a metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT).  HPRT is an enzyme in the purine salvage pathway and when deficient, causes the metabolite, urate, to build up.  This build-up can cause kidney stones and gout.  Primary symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan disease include neurological problems such as mental deficiency and self-destructive \n","behavior.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Analyze a cDNA sequence from a patient suspected to have Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome\n","\n","* Analyze the mutant HPRT protein using bioinformatics tools within Google Colab. \n","\n","* Investigate the structure of the HPRT protein, model the mutation, and find out what is known, if anything, about the biological impact of the mutation.\n","\n","* Form a hypothesis about what the structural and biological effects are of this mutation.\n","\n","* Organize the results of your research into a report which you will present at the end of the semester."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6b3fce44"},"source":["## Reading #1:\n","## NCBI online text: “Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases”\n","\n","The first set of readings is designed to give you an overview of metabolic disease and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS). \n","\n","REF:    \n","* National Center for Biotechnology Information (US).
